Repo Summary

Logistic Regression:
    Program that uses "titanic train" dataset to train a model that fits the dataset well and achieves maximum prediction accuracy.It uses logistic regression algorithm.
    Libraries used: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
    Contains plots.

randomforest.py :
    Program that use "loan_data" dataset and trains a model that performs classification using Random Forest Algorithm.
    Libraries used: pandes, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
    Contains plots(histograms)

KNN : 
    Program that uses "Classified data" dataset and trains a model using dataset. It uses K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm.
